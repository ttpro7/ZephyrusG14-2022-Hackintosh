# 💻 Zephyrus G14 Hackintosh EFI

OpenCore EFI configuration for **ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (2022)**  
with **AMD Ryzen 7 6800HS** and **Radeon RX 6700S**  
Compatible with: macOS Ventura / Sonoma / Sequoia

## ⚠️ Important: SMBIOS Setup Required

You **must manually generate your own SMBIOS**.

- This build spoofs **MacBookPro16,3** but emulates **MacPro7,1**
- Use `Sample.plist` and `SampleCustom.plist` from the official Acidanthera OpenCore repository
- Generate serials and UUID using **OpenCore Configurator**

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **AMD SMC support** — via `SMCAMDProcessor.kext`
- ✅ **RX 6700S GPU** — supported via `Noderx.kext`, full Metal and video acceleration
- ✅ **Brightness control** — partial, works with [BetterDisplay](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay)
- ✅ **ALC285 audio** — works, but not as high quality as in Windows → improve via [eqMac](https://eqmac.app/)
- ✅ **Touchpad, keyboard, HDMI, 120Hz display, PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD, USB ports, battery status, webcam** — all working
- ✅ **Wi-Fi**:
  - `itlwm.kext` + [HeliPort](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/HeliPort)
  - or `AirportItlwm-14-4.kext` (native support in macOS 14.4+)
  - 🔧 *Make sure to enable only one Wi-Fi kext in `config.plist`*
- ✅ **Sleep** — stable after disabling hybrid sleep and enabling S3 sleep mode
  - Use [UMAF (Smokeless)](https://github.com/DavidS95/Smokeless_UMAF)

  - ⚠️ Newer BIOS versions cause instability
  - 📦 BIOS for GA402RJ is included in the archive

    *BIOS flashing is at your own risk!*
